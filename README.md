# Robot Code for the 2020 FIRST Robotics Competition
For Troy Robotics 3952

------

## How to download the code:
1. Open up Git Bash, then run ``cd ~/Documents`` then ``git clone https://bitbucket.org/DoggySazHi/R2.git``.
2. Use the FRC VS Code 2020 to open the R2 folder found in your Documents.
3. Go back to Git Bash, run ``cd R2`` and ``git checkout (your branch name)`` if you have a branch.  
    
    If you do not have a branch, you can run ``git branch (a branch name not taken)`` and then check that out.  
    **NOTE:** You cannot push code onto master! You can only create pull requests to it.  

4. Start working! :)

## What you should do everytime you start working:
1. Open up Git Bash, run ``cd ~/Documents/R2``, then run ``git pull``.
2. Run ``git merge master`` to get the latest stuff. If there are conflicts, you deem what is good and what isn't.
   Usually, the newer code is more correct, however you can combine your code with the existing code if you're working on the same section.
3. Go to work!

## What you should do (almost) everytime you finish:
1. Open up Git Bash, run ``cd ~/Documents/R2``, then run ``git commit -m "(your message)" -a``.
2. Run ``git push`` to upload your code to this repo.
3. If you're done with a feature (see ***Issues***), commit, push, write a comment under the issue, and reference it in a new pull request.
    
    You should also refer the issue in your pull request by number. **DO NOT CLOSE ISSUES WITHOUT PERMISSION!**
   
## Issues ~~such as William~~
* To keep track of things to do, we use Issues (see left tab of BitBucket) to identify who works on what.
* If you want to take an un-assigned task, write a comment, or add yourself as an assignee.
* Want to mark something? Add an issue yourself!
* Priorities are priorities; don't mark everything as a major bug please.
